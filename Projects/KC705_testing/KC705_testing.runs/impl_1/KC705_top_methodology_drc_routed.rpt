TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_sys_diff[0] and trans_wiz_TxRx/U0/trans_wiz_init_i/trans_wiz_i/gt0_trans_wiz_i/gtxe2_i/TXOUTCLK are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_sys_diff[0]] -to [get_clocks trans_wiz_TxRx/U0/trans_wiz_init_i/trans_wiz_i/gt0_trans_wiz_i/gtxe2_i/TXOUTCLK]
